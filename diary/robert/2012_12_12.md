- Should order gesture trees in the moving tree object, so that gesture tree A has to occur before gesture tree B. The max and min delta times for B will therefore be relative to A's occurence time. 
- Gesture capturing is extremely complicated. The original design objective was to track hand movements, and to do that we need to track joints. Gesture tracking (in its basic form) as proved the original hypothesis that we could control a motor via hand motions. But I think I need to take a break from gesture tracking, since it's getting extremely complicated and involved, and it doesn't actually achieve the original objective. I spent about a week and a half on it, enough time develop a strong framework.
- Next objective: Joint Tracking. We want a motor to represent a joint. That means we need to know how much that joint has "moved." We don't care about translations. We care about joints bending, since that's all the motor will do. Therefore, look at the two joints connected to the tracked joint. Find the joint angle. Fire an event pertaining to the joint and containing its new angle. Skynet will subscribe to whatever joint it's tracking (and it will have an appropriate Skynet equivalent joint). Skynet will determine if the bend angle has changed sufficiently for the motor to have to turn on. (Is the frame rate too high. May have to filter.)
