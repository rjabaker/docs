- Recieved the Kinect AC adapter/power supply.
- Built a working motor control circuit. Can now change the direction and speed of the motor via the .NET application. Also, integrated an e-stop button, which cuts off the power supply when clicked; the power supply can be severed within the .NET application, also, since the motor's digital logic IC is powered by an arduino digital logic pin. This completes phase 1 of the motor building.
