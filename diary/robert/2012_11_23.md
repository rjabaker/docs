- Beginning to write set pinMode command.
- Should repeat the digital output voltage measurements with a different pin than pin 13, since it has an LED attached to it and this might affect the output voltage (which could be higher for the other pins).
- Did some research into the stepper motor I purchased. I do not think this motor is right for our project. The stepper motor performs "steps" in its rotations; each full rotation is divided into an equal number of steps. The motor can be commanded to hold at one of these steps. It seems to me that these motors expect the user to know the end result, or where to stop stepping. Our project requires the motor to respond to real time commands, which means that we can't command to motor to stop at a certain step in advance. We need to tell to motor to move at speed x and then speed y and then speed z, without knowing what the next speed will be. Also, aside from writing complicated command codes, controlling the stepper motor requires too much intelligence in the arduino, and our intention is to write a fairly stupid servo controller.
