- I think I may have to use a stepper motor. Refer here for more information: [http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Stepper](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Stepper)
- When joint tracking event is captured, it will contain the new bend angle. Create a parameter that sets the capture frequency, so that we only look at approximatley 5 updates per second per motor/joint (not 36 per second). Calculate the delta_time since last movement (used for speed). Then use the bend angle to build command. We will need a new stepper motor command, which sets the speed and moves the appropriate steps. Also, if the angle is so small that it's negligable, don't move the motor. But, you need to remember the angle, and the angle you're at, so that you can use this in future calculations.
