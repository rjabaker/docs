- Recieved the Kinect AC adapter/power supply.
- Built a working motor control circuit. Can now change the direction and speed of the motor via the .NET application. Also, integrated an e-stop button, which cuts off the power supply when clicked; the power supply can be severed within the .NET application, also, since the motor's digital logic IC is powered by an arduino digital logic pin. This completes phase 1 of the motor building.
- Began working with Kinect. I'm able to "track" skeletons, but I don't have much logic other than throwing an event when tracking has occurred and setting up which skeletons to track. Also, test code for this is sorely lacking. I'm considering using vectors for motion tracking.
- Began designing Vector Tails Motion Tracking Method.
