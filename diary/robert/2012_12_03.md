- Thought of an idea for gesture tracking. Treat the body as a tree. The head is the parent node. Iterate down the tree until reaching the leaf nodes, building the gestures. To do this, first look at a parent node (the head, for instance). Find that node's absolute angle. Then go down to the child node. Find it's angle, relative to the parent. Test if it fits within a tolerance value (a range of relative angles). You can use this method to identify gesutres (though you will probably have to look at three nodes to accomplish an arm gesture).
- Able to track and render skeletons. Used reference:

- Began implementing GestureTree algorithm.
