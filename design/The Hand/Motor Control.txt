## Motor Control

#### Phase 1: Single Motor Control, No Speed Variation

This phase has the following specifications:

- Via the Windows application, allow the user to turn on/off a motor.
- The user should have the ability to make the motor spin clockwise and anti-clockwise.
- The motor should have an emergency stop (or e-stop) button/switch that a user can manually press.
- To make the motor spin clockwise, the user should set pin X on. To make the motor spin anti-clockwise, the user should set pin Y on. If both pin X and Y are on at the same time, the motor should not spin.
- If the e-stop button/switch is on, regardless of pin X and Y, the motor should not spin.
